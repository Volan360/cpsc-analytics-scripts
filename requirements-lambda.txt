# Runtime dependencies for Lambda deployment only.
# boto3/botocore are excluded — already provided by the Lambda Python 3.12 runtime.
# Heavy data-science packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn,
# kaleido, fpdf2) are excluded — they are not imported by any Lambda source file.
# Dev/test tools (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, etc.) belong in requirements.txt only.
